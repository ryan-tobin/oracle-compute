## Vision

Oracle implements precognitive computation - algorithms that can access their own future states and results before computing them. This enables unprecedented efficiency and the ability to solve previously unsolvable computational problems.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oracle-compute.git
cd oracle-compute
./scripts/build/build_all.sh

# Run first example
./examples/basic/hello_oracle
```
## Core Concepts

- Retrocasual Algorithms: Algorithms influenced by their own future states
- Precognitive Optimization: Optimization using future execution knowledge
- Casual Loop Computing: Self-creatin computational conditions

## Architecture
Oracle integrates multiple programming languages strategically:

- Assembly/C: Temporal state manipulation and prediction kernels
- Rust: Memory-safe temporal data ownership
- Python: High-level precognitive modeling
- JavaScript: Temporal promise resolution
- Go: Concurrent temporal coordination
